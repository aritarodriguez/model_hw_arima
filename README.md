# model_hw_arima
Overview

This project performs a basic time series analysis and forecasting using the built-in AirPassengers dataset in R.
The goal is to model and predict future airline passenger volumes using two classical forecasting methods:

Holt-Winters exponential smoothing

ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)

The exercise compares the performance of both models based on their residual errors.
